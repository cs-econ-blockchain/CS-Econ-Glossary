| Reinforcement Learning | Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that must learn behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. | Computer Science | https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10166 |
| Policy | A policy defines the learning agent’s way of behaving at a given time. Roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Value Function | A value function specifies what is good in the long run. Roughly speaking, the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Optimal Policy | A policy whose value functions are optimal is an optimal policy. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Reward Signal | A reward signal defines the goal of a reinforcement learning problem. On each time step, the environment sends to the reinforcement learning agent a single number called the reward. The agent’s sole objective is to maximize the total reward it receives over the long run. | Computer Science |https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Mechanism Design | Mechanism design theory provides a coherent framework for analyzing this great variety of institutions, or “allocation mechanisms”, with a focus on the problems associated with incentives and private information. | Economics | https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-economicsciences2007.pdf |
| Batch Auction | A uniform-price sealed-bid double auctions conducted at frequent but discrete time intervals. | Economics | https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.104.5.418  |
| Static First-price Auction | Bidders submit simultaneous “sealed bids” to the seller. The terminology comes from the original format for such auctions, in which bids were written down and provided in sealed envelopes to the seller, who would then open them all together. The highest bidder wins the object and pays the value of her bid. | Economics | https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch09.pdf |
| Transaction Fee | Transactions require a fee that users have to pay for the computation, and must be mined to become valid. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/ | 
| Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM) | A transaction fee mechanism (TFM) is a triple (x, p, q) in which x is a feasible allocation rule, p is a payment rule, and q is a burning rule. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf |
| Easy Fee Estimation |Easy fee estimation guarantees that the “obvious” bidding strategy is optimal. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf |
| Market Congestion/Latency Effect | The propagation time for an Ethereum block could not be neglected compared with this 15-second block interval. Therefore, part of the computational power might be congested to a stale view. These congestion nodes create stale blocks mining on top of their outdated blockchain. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8963680 |
| Waiting Time | The difference between the time when we first observe the transaction in mempool and when the transaction is mined. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574.pdf |
| User Incentive Compatibility (UIC) | Assuming that the miner implements the mechanism honestly, then following the honest bidding strategy or truthful bidding should be a dominant strategy for the users. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151.pdf |
| Miner Incentive Compatibility (MIC) | A miner’s dominant strategy should be to implement the prescribed mechanism faithfully. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151.pdf | 
| Miner-User Side Contract Proofness (SCP) | No coalition of the miner and up to certain amount of users can increase their joint utility through any deviation. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151.pdf |
| Security Requirements | The three dimensions that a desirable/dream transaction fee mechanism should satisfy. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03151.pdf |
| Learning Rate | It calibrates the size of the adjustment according to the current block size. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04753.pdf |
| Block Size | Blocks are bounded in size. Each block has a target size of 15 million gas but the size of blocks will increase or decrease in accordance with network demands, up until the block limit of 30 million gas. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/ |
| Mempool | Mempool is where transactions stay after sent by users and before being added to a block by miners. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574.pdf |
