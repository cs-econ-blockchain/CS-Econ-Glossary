| Reinforcement Learning | Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that must learn behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. | Computer Science | https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10166 |
| Policy | A policy defines the learning agentâ€™s way of behaving at a given time. Roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Value Function | A value function specifies what is good in the long run. Roughly speaking, the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Optimal Policy | A policy whose value functions are optimal is an optimal policy. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition }
