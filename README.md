| Reinforcement Learning | Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that must learn behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. | Computer Science | https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10166 |
| Policy | A policy defines the learning agent’s way of behaving at a given time. Roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Value Function | A value function specifies what is good in the long run. Roughly speaking, the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Optimal Policy | A policy whose value functions are optimal is an optimal policy. | Computer Science | https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Reward Signal | A reward signal defines the goal of a reinforcement learning problem. On each time step, the environment sends to the reinforcement learning agent a single number called the reward. The agent’s sole objective is to maximize the total reward it receives over the long run. | Computer Science |https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition |
| Mechanism Design | Mechanism design theory provides a coherent framework for analyzing this great variety of institutions, or “allocation mechanisms”, with a focus on the problems associated with incentives and private information. | Economics | https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-economicsciences2007.pdf |
｜ Batch Auction ｜ A uniform-price sealed-bid double auctions conducted at frequent but discrete time intervals.｜ Economics | https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.104.5.418 |
| Static First-price Auction | Bidders submit simultaneous “sealed bids” to the seller. The terminology comes from the original format for such auctions, in which bids were written down and provided in sealed envelopes to the seller, who would then open them all together. The highest bidder wins the object and pays the value of her bid. | Economics | https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch09.pdf |
| Transaction Fee | Transactions require a fee that users have to pay for the computation, and must be mined to become valid. | Ethereum Blockchain | https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/ |
