| Challenge-Response | an implementation of a pattern in which some party must respond to a challenge within a fixed time limit | This paper |
| Challenge window| the time period between $T_c$ and $T_{rd}$, where a challenge that takes effect at time $T_c$ and a response deadline $T_{rd}$ which is the
latest time by which response to the challenge will be accepted| This paper |
| Congestion |
| Robustness |
| Uncongestion | By using 'L Consecutive Blocks' protocol, where it defines the existence of L consecutive uncongested blocks |
